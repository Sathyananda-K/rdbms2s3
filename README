Generic Module to get data from RDBMS database (test with DB2 on zOS, DB2 on iSeries, PostgreSQL and MS SQL)
Uses pyodbc framework with boto3 AWS api.

Main Module - rdbms2S3.py :
rdbms2S3.py uses db2csv.py module to get rows in CSV format and s3uploader.py places the CSV file in S3 bucket

db2csv.py:
Module uses array size setup to streamline buffered rows collection to reduce DB I/O operations to minimum.

s3uploader.py:
Modules uses logic of multiple part upload technique to avoid creation of large local file.

SQL can be placed in S3 bucket and as-well in local with table_name.txt format
and configuration file can be used to do required setup.

Also provided driver files in driver directories for
- DB2 on zOS
- DB2 on iSeries
- postgreSQL
- MS SQL

Also included Dockerfile and Yaml files if setup need to be deployed in AWS Kub (K8s)

To run the program from line command:
python rdbms2S3.py -tn "tableName" -sd "StartDate" -ed "StartDate"
